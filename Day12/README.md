# Day 12: Advanced Kubernetes Networking

Welcome to Day 12 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, we'll delve into advanced Kubernetes networking concepts and solutions, including Container Network Interface (CNI) and Calico.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **CNI and Calico**: Understand advanced Kubernetes networking concepts.
- **Use Cases**: Explore real-world use cases for advanced networking solutions.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: CNI and Calico Overview
- Research and read about Container Network Interface (CNI) and [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/), a popular networking solution for Kubernetes.

### Task 2: Setting Up Calico
- If you have a Kubernetes cluster, try setting up Calico as your network plugin. Alternatively, use Minikube or another cluster for experimentation.

### Task 3: Exploring Advanced Networking
- Explore advanced networking topics, such as network policies, security, and observability with Calico.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Implement network policies using Calico in your Kubernetes cluster to secure communication between pods.
